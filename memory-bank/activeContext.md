# BUSFinder Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Setting up the foundational memory bank documentation for the BUSFinder Android application. The project is in its initial development phase with core architecture and basic components implemented.

## Recent Changes
- **Project Structure**: Established MVVM architecture with clear separation of data, UI, and viewmodel layers
- **Database Setup**: Implemented Room database with BusDatabase and SearchHistoryDao
- **Data Models**: Created BusRoute and SearchHistoryItem entities
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented BusRepository for data access abstraction
- **UI Components**: Basic SearchBar and BusItem components created
- **Screens**: HomeScreen and SearchScreen implemented
- **Theming**: Material Design 3 theme system established
- **Localization**: English and Bengali language support added

## Next Steps
1. **Data Population**: Load and parse bus_routes.json data
2. **Search Implementation**: Complete search functionality with filtering
3. **Navigation**: Implement proper screen navigation flow
4. **UI Polish**: Enhance component styling and animations
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests for ViewModels and Repository
6. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and UI rendering
7. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error states
8. **Settings Screen**: Add user preferences and app settings

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **MVVM Pattern**: Chosen for its separation of concerns and testability
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides clean data access abstraction
- **Room Database**: Selected for local data persistence with SQLite
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI framework for Android

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Material Design 3**: Ensures modern, consistent design language
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Bengali for broader accessibility
- **Offline-First**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only essential permissions requested

### Technical Decisions
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations
- **Flow**: Reactive data streams from database
- **JSON Assets**: Static bus route data for offline functionality
- **Version Catalog**: Centralized dependency management

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- **Kotlin Idiomatic Code**: Leverage language features effectively
- **Null Safety**: Use nullable types and safe calls appropriately
- **Extension Functions**: For utility functions and readability
- **Data Classes**: For model objects and simple data structures

### Naming Conventions
- **Packages**: Feature-based organization (data, ui, viewmodel)
- **Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive names
- **Functions**: camelCase with verb-noun pattern
- **Variables**: camelCase with meaningful names

### Error Handling
- **Try-Catch**: For database and I/O operations
- **Sealed Classes**: For representing different states/results
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Graceful Degradation**: App remains functional during errors

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
- **Room Database**: Efficient local data storage with type safety
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI development paradigm
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Simplified asynchronous programming
- **Material Design 3**: Comprehensive design system components

### Architecture Insights
- **MVVM Benefits**: Clear separation enables better testing and maintenance
- **Repository Pattern**: Simplifies data source changes and testing
- **Single Source of Truth**: Repository as central data authority
- **State Management**: Proper state hoisting prevents UI inconsistencies

### Development Insights
- **Offline-First Design**: Critical for transportation apps in areas with poor connectivity
- **Performance Optimization**: Database queries and UI rendering need early optimization
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and fast search are crucial for user retention
- **Accessibility**: Multi-language support significantly expands user base

### Current Challenges
- **Data Management**: Efficient handling of potentially large bus route datasets
- **Search Performance**: Fast search across multiple fields and criteria
- **UI Responsiveness**: Smooth scrolling and transitions with large datasets
- **Memory Management**: Optimize for low-end Android devices

## Development Priorities
1. **Core Functionality**: Complete basic search and route display
2. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and UI rendering
3. **User Experience**: Polish interactions and add smooth animations
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date memory bank and code documentation
