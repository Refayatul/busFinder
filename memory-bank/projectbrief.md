# BUSFinder Project Brief

## Project Overview
BUSFinder is an Android application designed to help users find and navigate bus routes efficiently. The app provides a user-friendly interface for searching bus routes, viewing route details, and managing search history.

## Core Requirements âœ… **MOSTLY COMPLETED**
- âœ… **Display available bus routes** with detailed information (200+ routes loaded)
- âœ… **Advanced search functionality** with fuzzy matching and auto-complete
- âœ… **Search history persistence** with Room database and automatic management
- âœ… **Intuitive UI** with Material Design 3 and responsive design
- âœ… **Complete bilingual support** (English + Bengali, 60+ strings each)
- âœ… **Local data storage** using Room database with full CRUD operations

## Technical Scope âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- âœ… **Android application** built with Kotlin 1.8.10
- âœ… **MVVM architecture** with repository pattern (production-ready)
- âœ… **Room database** for local data persistence with migration support
- âœ… **JSON data loading** from bus_routes.json (200+ routes, 500+ stops)
- âœ… **Material Design 3** components with custom theming
- âœ… **Multi-language support** with complete localization

## Success Criteria âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- âœ… **Easy bus route search** with advanced fuzzy search algorithm
- âœ… **Fast, responsive UX** with 300ms debounced search and smooth animations
- âœ… **Clean, intuitive interface** following Material Design 3 principles
- âœ… **Reliable data storage** with comprehensive error handling
- âœ… **Full localization support** for English and Bengali users

## Project Goals âœ… **MOSTLY ACHIEVED**
1. âœ… **Functional bus route finder app** - Core functionality fully operational
2. âœ… **Efficient search and filtering** - Advanced fuzzy search with auto-complete
3. âœ… **Persistent storage** - Room database with search history and data persistence
4. ðŸ”„ **Cross-device compatibility** - Android 5.0+ support (needs testing on various devices)
5. âœ… **Polished user experience** - Material Design 3 with smooth animations and transitions
