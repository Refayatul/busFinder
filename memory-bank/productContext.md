# BUSFinder Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Public transportation can be challenging to navigate, especially in urban areas with complex bus networks. Users often struggle to find the right bus routes, understand route details, and remember their previous searches. BUSFinder addresses these pain points by providing a centralized, easy-to-use application for bus route discovery and management.

1. **Route Discovery**: Users can easily search and browse available bus routes without needing to consult multiple sources
2. **Route Information**: Detailed route information including stops, schedules, and key landmarks
3. **Search History**: Persistent storage of previous searches for quick access to frequently used routes
4. **Language Barriers**: Multi-language support (English and Bengali) to serve diverse user groups
5. **Offline Access**: Local data storage ensures the app works without constant internet connectivity

2. **Search Functionality**: Fast, intuitive search with autocomplete and filtering options
3. **Route Details**: Comprehensive view of route information including stops and navigation hints
